# Window-Maze
Randomly generated maze game built with photoresistors and controlled by an Arduino Uno. In the program, the maze is stored in a 4x3 array. The user controls movement through a 2x3 grid of photoresistors, which acts as a moving “window” showing the user’s current row and the row ahead. This design was chosen due to hardware limitations of the Arduino Uno, as it didn't have enough inputs to connect more than 6 photoresistors to it at a time, which made creating a full physical grid impossible. Each photoresistor represents one cell in the maze, and the user can make a move by tapping one of the photoresistors. If the user takes too long or makes 3 incorrect moves, they lose the game. Collaborated with two other team members to design the project for ENGR 1 class.
